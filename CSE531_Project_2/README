To compile and run main.c please give the following commands:

        To compile : gcc -o thread_test thread_test.c
        To run:      ./thread_test

NOTE:

-The thread_test.c code has four threads, threads with ID 1 and 2 call function f1 and threads with ID three and four call function f2.
-Both function f1 and f2 increment a global counter and their respective local counts.
-As expected the the global count is shared by all threads and the local counts are not.
